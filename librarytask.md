CODE CHALLENGE TASK 3

Model a library using objects. * Â 

A library contains shelves.
Shelves contain books.
Books have an author and a title.

Give the library methods to add and remove a shelf. A shelf should have methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in its own file. Add any functionality you think appropriate.



PLAN:
1. Page has title
2. Button to add shelve to library
3. Once shelf is made, show form to add books to that shelf
4. each shelf display with add book form/button

JS NEEDS:

- function libraryAddShelf
- function libraryRemoveShelf
- function shelfAddBook
- function shelfRemoveBook
- var library
- var shelf
- var book
- "generate report"

ASSIGN BOOK TO RIGHT SHELF:

// if findshelf(bookGenre)
//     addBook
// else addshelf(bookGenre)
//     addBook

//     function (book, shelf)
// if (findShelf)
//    addBook
// else (addShelf)
//      addBook

// In the end, I would like this to look something like this: index.html has
// "add shelf to our library". then you add as many as you want.
// and with each shelf, there's an addbook,
// so when you add it just goes to that one shelf
// Everything would populate in list forms
